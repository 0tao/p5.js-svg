# p5.js-svg

SVG module for p5.js (still coding).

## So, why SVG?

- Resolution Independence

- Tool chains!

    SVG works with Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.
    It would be wonderful if designers can easily export their p5.js to SVG,
    and continue their work using SVG.
    Also, it would be great if p5.js can import SVG,
    because many resources are in SVG.

- Accessibility

    Different from canvas, SVGs are accessible.
    That is, the text can be selected, easily copied and used for TTS.

- Object Based Events

    Want to bind click events on a custom shape? Use SVG!
    SVG's API are born to be object based!

- Filters!

    Now that SVGs are object based,
    we can apply filters on object. (use blur, for example)
